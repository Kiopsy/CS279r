# To-Do List: Node.js & MongoDB
For this assignment, the majority of the code is based off the [tutorial](https://medium.com/@diogo.fg.pinheiro/simple-to-do-list-app-with-node-js-and-mongodb-chapter-1-c645c7a27583) from the assignment description. I changed some UI for the beyond To-Do list functionality. To run the website, download and extract the ZIP folder. Then, run "npm start" in the terminal in the directory of the ZIP folder, and open your browser and search "http://localhost:3000/". 

## Differences from HTML/CSS/Javascript
Node.js allows you to share library environments through each project (to make it easy to run projects on different computers). This allows you to make projects more advanced when compared to what we did in HTML/CSS. Furthermore, using MongoDB allows users to store tasks even when closing the website/app, which was not possible when just using HTML, CSS, and Javascript alone.
