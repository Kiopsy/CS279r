# To-Do List: Sveltekit TodoApp with Firebase Backend
For most of this assignment, the code is based off the [Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm_Qt4aKpfKiGbdjaHdOpry6Neza0etxZ). I changed only changed some of the UI. To run the website, download and extract the ZIP folder. Run "npm install" in the terminal in the directory of the ZIP folder, then run "npm run dev". Open your browser and search "http://localhost:3000/". Just note, sometimes I get this weird bug with my todoapp that does not allow me to delete the last todo in the list.  

## Differences from previous frameworks
Svelte is interesting, but super similar to Node.js as it allows us to place Svelte code within HTML even using for loops. Furthermore, we write in Javascript and even start the app using npm install, and npm run dev. Furthermore, we connect the firebase database similarly to MongoDB, and I am not exactly sure based off the todoapp the differences between MongoDB and Firebase. They both fit the todo app really well; however, Firebase was much more annoying to implement as its previous versions (from Firebase 8 to 9) have incredibly different syntaxes, and make it VERY difficult to follow and debug online tutorials.
