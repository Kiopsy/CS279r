# To-Do List: Flutter
For this assignment, the code is based off the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4P5DZ9TRns) from the assignment description. I changed some UI for the beyond To-Do list functionality by adding a searchBox and changing around the searching algorithm, switching colors, and adding a scroll view and fixed the margins/padding to prevent overflow. To run the application, download the Flutter SDK from https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install, and download the Flutter VS code extension. Unzip the folder and open within VS code. On the bottom right corner, make sure Flutter SDK is loaded, and select the type of device to use (for example, just select Chrome). Then lastly, run 
without debugging using VS code, and the application will run by popping up the application.

## Differences from HTML/CSS/Javascript & Node.js
Flutter allows us to run our application on every device (HTML, android, ios, windows, macos, linux) which is a definite advantage to everything we have used in the past. Compared to Node.js which allows us to share library environments through each project (to make it easy to run projects on different computers), Flutter allows us to share environments on every device. It makes Flutter very versatile and is definitely a huge plus compared to what we have used in this class! Also, we cannot compare Mongo.db to Flutter as it is not primarily database focused.
