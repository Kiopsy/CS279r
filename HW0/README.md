# To-Do List: HTML, CSS, Javascript
For this assignment, the majority of the code is based off the [W3schools To-Do List tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp). I changed the UI, and I added confetti animations in Javascript from [this link](https://dev.to/official_fire/creating-a-confetti-effect-in-5-minutes-16h3) for the beyond To-Do list functionality. To run the website, download and extract the ZIP folder and just open the todo.html file as you would any other application.
