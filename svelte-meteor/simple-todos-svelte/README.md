# TodoApp: Svelte and Meteor
Instructions: ensure that meteor is downloaded on your computer (also, make sure that you are on Node.js version 14, navigating versions with nvm). Then, download the zip of this svelte-meteor folder. When in the folder, run this code: 

cd simple-todos-svelte
meteor run

Note that meteor run will take a while..as it has to download all of the libraries.

Then, open the url that pops up in the terminal. (pops up like http://localhost:3000/). Then when prompted to the app, use the following as login:

User: meteorite
Password: password

Then add todos as you please!

## Differences with Svelte/Meteor than other frameworks used in the past
Svelte/Meteor is cool as it can run web and mobile applications (kinda similar to flutter), but has a bunch of easy features that we can run and use. For example, Meteor automatically adds MongoDB making it super easy to integrate a database with our application (which was definitely more difficult with other frameworks.) Also, Meteor works with Node.js making it easy to integrate libraries and downloads using npm!
